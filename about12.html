                        <p>I dream of a better tomorrow! where chickens can cross the roads and not have their motives questioned. Who doesn't love a totally strange message from a stranger about something completely random?</p>
                		<p>LOL. Hey there reader! Thanks for visiting my this page by now you already know my name in case you missed it feel free to scroll up. I was bored this summer so I decided to this hoping it's cool but we'll see how it goes. </p>
						<p> Honestly, I was struggling to write an About me page, because for starters I don't really know where to start and for seconds this was something we were made to do in an English class growing up LOL so it brings bak memory.</p>
						<p>Nonetheless, I'll start by telling you that I am currently a student at the University of Toronto specializing in Machine Learning and Data Mining. I am expected to graduate by the Fall of 2020. You might be wondering why did he choose this major, what was going through his mind. Well, I am glad you asked reader. To be completely honest, I didn't know what I wanted to do. I knew I could code from high school having learned C++ and I definitely liked being creative with my work and coding seemed to be a way to do it, but I wasn't really sure. After going through the first year, I wasn't doing too well and I didn't really think I could even make the post for any major.  </p>

	<div class="container">
	<p>I was good at Calculus and really good in Statistics and that's all I knew from the first year with no direction of where I wanted to go. As any person who doesn't know how to do something in my case what to do. I decided to google my options, weight the pros, and the cons and to generally follow the five steps of making a decision. During my research, I kept finding AI and machine learning as a promising career, and believe me when I tell you I was always fascinated by it. But I just always thought that they were only offered in a masters program. I was wrong ! and in fact, at UTSC you could specialize in Statistics: Ml and Data Mining. That summer of 2016, I gave my all to raise my GPA and succeded and finally made the post.</p>
	<p>As they say, getting in is the easy part, getting out is something else entirely. I don't know who says that in case no one said it you heard it here first folks. Throughout my university experience, I didn't really know why I was taking certain courses and I feel like that's most of the student out there. But then I remembered a quote from Steve Jobs at his commencement speech at Stanford.</p>

	<p>And soo it was, by taking the B levels, C levels and D levels. It started to connect how you
	had to learn the pure math and stats of it all to apply ML algorithms to do awesome stuff.
	So below are some of the courses I have taken that have given me the necessary skill to do awesome stuff </p>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>MATB61 Linear Programming and Optimization</li>
  <li><b>CSCB07 Software Design</b></li>
  <li>CSCC37 Introduction to Numerical Algorithms </li>
<li><b>STAC51 Categorical Data Analysis </b>  </li>
<li><b>CSCB20 Database and Web Development </b>  </li>
<li>STAC62 Stochastic Processes</li>
<li><b>MATC44 Intro to Combinatorics</b>  </li>
<li>STAC67 Regression Analysis</li>
<li><b>STAC58 Statistical Inference</b> </li>
<li><b>MATC90 Begin of Mathematics</b></li>
<li><b>STAC50 Data Collection</b> </li>
<li>STAD37 Multivariate Analysis </li>
<li><b>STAD93 Large Sample Theory</b></li>
<li><b>CSCC11 Machine Learning</b> </li>
<li><b>STAC33 Applied Statistics</b></li>
<li>CSC384 Artificial Intellegence</li>
<li>STAD68 Advance Machine Learnng</li>
</ul>  
</div>
<br>
<p>I have also worked on several projects, you can go check them out at the tab above. And as all good things, come to an end so does this page. I'd like to thank you for reading all the way down and I appreciate you taking the time to know a little bit about me. If you have any questions or just want to say hi.
